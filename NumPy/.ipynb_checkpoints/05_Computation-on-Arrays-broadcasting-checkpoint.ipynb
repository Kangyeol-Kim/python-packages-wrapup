    "Another means of vectorizing operations is to use NumPy's broadcasting functionality. Broadcasting is simply a set of rules for applying binary ufuncs (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) on arrays of different sizes. Broadcasting allows these types of binary operations to be performed on arrays of different sizesâ€“for example, we can just as easily add a scalar (think of it as a zero-dimensional array) to an array:"
